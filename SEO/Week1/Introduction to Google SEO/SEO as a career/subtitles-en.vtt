00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.635
Let's discuss your career
options and growth as an SEO.

2
00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:16.060
SEO is a career choice
that continues to grow,

3
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.410
and become more and more

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.650
established within the
marketing industry.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.120
In fact, it is now considered

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.830
a core skillset for
marketers to have,

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.940
so even if you're not planning on

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.310
being the SEO of a team,

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.455
having SEO knowledge
is a great benefit.

10
00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:34.410
For more information,
I've provided

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.200
a link to a post I
wrote on the subject.

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.695
SEO is unique in that,

13
00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:41.575
it is a specialist role,

14
00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.890
but in order to
effectively practice SEO,

15
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.650
one needs to wear
multiple hats that allow

16
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.750
them to both develop
holistic SEO strategies,

17
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.220
and communicate those
strategies to clients,

18
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.800
and, or internal departments.

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.575
SEO is a role that benefits in

20
00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.505
knowledge of complementary
marketing disciplines,

21
00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:07.430
it also works well by
complementing other roles.

22
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.005
Other roles it
complements include,

23
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:14.010
content marketing,
social media, CROS,

24
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.020
or conversion rate
optimization specialists,

25
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.945
user experience
specialists, PR, and more.

26
00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:26.030
There are many career
options for an SEO,

27
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.285
for example, you can
work as a consultant,

28
00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:33.580
as part of an agency
selling marketing services,

29
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.550
as part of a business,

30
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.860
which is known as in-house SEO,

31
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.500
and from there you could
work for a small business,

32
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380
a startup, or even

33
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.865
larger corporate, or
enterprise-level clients.

34
00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:47.720
I've had the privilege of

35
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.910
working both consultant, agency,

36
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.100
and in-house, and I write about

37
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.235
these experiences
frequently on my blog.

38
00:01:55.235 --> 00:01:57.755
With all of these career options,

39
00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:00.125
you may also be working alongside

40
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.124
other SEO teams, for example,

41
00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:06.860
when working in-house,
it's not uncommon to

42
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.360
work alongside an agency
or an SEO consultant.

43
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.220
This is especially true

44
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.300
for larger corporations,
generally,

45
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.880
outside SEOs may be
brought in for things

46
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.660
like specific technical
or platform expertise,

47
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.350
or helping to scale an
existing SEO's strategy,

48
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.895
such as a link building,

49
00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:31.650
or content marketing strategy.

50
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.010
They can be brought in for

51
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.260
a number of specific situations,

52
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.599
so whether you're
an in-house SEO,

53
00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.685
consultant, or agency side,

54
00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:47.280
it's a good idea to
understand the role of

55
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.210
SEO in areas outside of your own.

56
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.825
This will help you to work
alongside them if necessary.

57
00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:57.285
Regardless of your career path,

58
00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:00.965
you will need to be able to
effectively do the following.

59
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:03.460
Relate your recommendations to

60
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.140
company objectives and goals.

61
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.890
Effectively estimate the
value individual SEO effort

62
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.180
you can provide the company.

63
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.770
Be ready and able to

64
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.120
back up your
recommendations with data,

65
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.935
past case studies, or more,

66
00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:25.100
and prioritize
effectively, so when you

67
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.210
have to choose between

68
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.820
implementing two major
recommendations,

69
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.750
you can do so quickly and easily.

70
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.600
In all of these areas,

71
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.130
you will need a specific set of

72
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.125
skills that will
help you succeed.

73
00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:38.895
I urge you to review

74
00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:42.855
SEO job listings and see
what roles are hiring,

75
00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.370
and what skills they both

76
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.835
explicitly and
implicitly request.

77
00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:49.710
Some skills you will find

78
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.085
useful are interpersonal skills,

79
00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:55.860
project management and planning,

80
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.595
having the ability to
think strategically,

81
00:03:59.595 --> 00:04:03.585
being agile and proactive,

82
00:04:03.585 --> 00:04:09.540
being able to stay updated
on industry trends and news,

83
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.225
and the ability to analyze data,

84
00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:15.070
and draw conclusions from it.

85
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.890
It might be important to discuss

86
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.780
some interview tips, well,

87
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.700
this may not apply
to consultants,

88
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.220
pretty much every
SEO at some point

89
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.460
or another will need to
interview for a job.

90
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.400
Here are some tips on
acing the interview.

91
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.210
Number 1 tip, you should
have a portfolio prepared.

92
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.815
This will help highlight
your past work,

93
00:04:38.815 --> 00:04:43.400
and allow you to showcase
your practical experience.

94
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.130
Even if this course is
your first experience,

95
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.170
doing any type of rescue,

96
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.780
completing the exercises
will help you build

97
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.140
a portfolio and have examples
of work that you've done,

98
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.630
and experience that you have.

99
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.110
Number 2, reference specific
and relevant examples.

100
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.609
During the interview, the
interview will explain

101
00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:11.560
how the SEO role at the
particular company will function,

102
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.675
and some specific
challenges they are facing,

103
00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:17.180
if they don't, be sure to ask.

104
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.430
When they do talk about this,

105
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.380
try to find an opportunity

106
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.280
to take the challenges they face,

107
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.370
and provide solutions based on

108
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.495
past work you have done that
has seen positive results.

109
00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:33.570
If you don't have specific
experience in that area,

110
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.370
but know a great opportunity

111
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.080
based on theoretical knowledge,

112
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.360
for example, be sure to bring up

113
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.675
what you would suggest
doing in that case.

114
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.420
Make sure to ask
questions that help you

115
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.895
understand the needs
of the company,

116
00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:51.360
and where SEO will fit
within their organization,

117
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.425
uncovering these needs will
help you determine if one,

118
00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:58.230
the role is right
for you, and if so,

119
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.820
how you can best support

120
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.920
the company in
meeting their goals.

121
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.070
I've provided some example
questions you can ask here.

122
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.130
Last but not least,

123
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.055
make sure to practice ahead
of time with the friend.

124
00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:13.980
It helps to practice
thinking on your feet rather

125
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.170
than trying to memorize a list
of questions and answers.

126
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.190
This will often come off as
rehearsed and not genuine.

127
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.415
I'd like to leave you with
a word of caution, in SEO,

128
00:06:25.415 --> 00:06:28.970
it is not at all uncommon
for businesses to

129
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.010
ask you to do a case study prior

130
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.465
to moving on an
interview process.

131
00:06:33.465 --> 00:06:37.970
However, I want to caution
you to be wary of companies

132
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.160
requesting case
studies that involve

133
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.860
an unusual amount
of time and effort.

134
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.660
While it is not uncommon to

135
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.220
request a small amount of work

136
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.654
as proof that you can
perform the tasks required,

137
00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:52.310
there are some more shady job ads

138
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.530
out there that basically use

139
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.450
the interview process as

140
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.385
an opportunity to get a lot
of free work from SEOs.

141
00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:03.105
To avoid situations like this,

142
00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:05.489
I recommend that you be cautious

143
00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:08.370
of jobs on free posting sites,

144
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.550
jobs posted on sites like
LinkedIn, for example,

145
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.304
tend to be more trustworthy,

146
00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:15.720
but this doesn't mean
they're always trustworthy,

147
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.240
so still be cautious.

148
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.710
Next, it's a good idea to
look up the company profile,

149
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.665
and just make sure that
they're a legitimate company.

150
00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:30.240
Also, you can read reviews
on sites like Glassdoor,

151
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.620
and you can read reviews,

152
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.945
especially around the
interview process,

153
00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:35.805
so take some time
going through those,

154
00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:37.845
and seeing if you've
seen complaints

155
00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:41.160
of really lengthy
interview process,

156
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.325
or the interview
requesting a lot of work.

157
00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:46.280
Remember though, that just

158
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.030
because you did do a case study,

159
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.910
and perhaps didn't get extended

160
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.120
a job offer doesn't
mean it was a scam,

161
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.795
but if it was an extensive
and time-consuming request,

162
00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:58.370
and you didn't hear back,

163
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.100
you should make an effort
to note this on sites like

164
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.900
Glassdoor so you can help

165
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.720
call out companies that do this,

166
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.549
and help alert other
potential job interviewers

167
00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:11.570
of what might be down
the road for them.
