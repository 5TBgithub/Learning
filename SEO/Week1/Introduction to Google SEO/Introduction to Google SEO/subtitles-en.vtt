In this first lesson,

Which we'll get into more in
depth in the next lesson.

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.444
SEO stands for search engine optimization,

7
00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:32.540
which is the practice of improving
a websites visibility in search.

8
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.863
SEO fits into a larger digital
marketing strategy, and

9
00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:39.220
is more focused on obtaining
free organic traffic.

10
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.740
Other digital marketing roles can work
in close alignment with an SEO strategy.

11
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.635
Other roles within the digital marketing
umbrella includes search engine marketing,

12
00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:51.180
which is the practice forbidding for
paid advertisements and search engines.

13
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.380
Social Media Marketing,
which can encompass both free and

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.270
paid social advertising and
engagement practices.

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.934
Content Marketing, which focuses
on writing concept for blogs,

16
00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:02.740
newsletters and more.

17
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.355
Public relations, which focuses
on acquiring relationships and

18
00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:10.040
promoting newsworthy content and
other related roles.

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.216
To fully succeed in SEO,

20
00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.744
you will need to have a good understanding
of these disciplines, as well as

21
00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:19.140
the ability to work closely with other
marketing roles for your mutual benefit.

22
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.912
You will even discover many
different schools of thought and

23
00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:24.740
specializations within
the SEO industry itself.

24
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.810
For example, some people like to choose
a specialization such as local SEO,

25
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.306
Technical SEO, or SEO Copywriting.

26
00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:36.340
While others like to have a broader
specialization and work in all areas.

27
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.423
There's even contention among SEOs
about white hat versus black hat versus

28
00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:41.004
gray hat.

29
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:45.080
White hat SEO as follows searching and
best practices laid out by Google and

30
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.390
other search engines.

31
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.235
While black hat SEOs tend
to go against the grain and

32
00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:53.023
participate in what some might
consider manipulative practices.

33
00:01:53.023 --> 00:01:55.440
Gray hats tend to be
somewhere in the middle.

34
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.989
Black hat SEOs tend to get hit by
penalties more frequently, and

35
00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.340
are known for more churn and
burn approach to SEO.

36
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.040
In this course,
we are focusing on white hat tactics,

37
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.880
that will not result in you getting
penalized or banned from search engines.

38
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.732
However, I do advocate spending some time
on your own to learn about the different

39
00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.260
SEO schools of thought.

40
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.231
You may also wish to test various
practices on your own websites as this

41
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:23.694
will help you gain a better understanding
of how search engines and SEO works.

42
00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:28.740
With the SEO, The best way to learn is
through practice and continual testing.

43
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.140
During this course, we will refer
to search engines quite frequently.

44
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.418
The major search engines are Google,
Yahoo, and Bing,

45
00:02:35.418 --> 00:02:38.300
though there are lesser
known search engines.

46
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.411
These include international
search engines such as Baidu,

47
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.500
which is China's major search engine.

48
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.038
Yandex, which is Russia's major
search engine, and Naver,

49
00:02:47.038 --> 00:02:50.140
which is South Korea's
major search engine.

50
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.452
Unless you are working on an international
SEO strategy, and using foreign languages,

51
00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:56.830
you won't work much with
these search engines.

52
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.255
However, it is important
to know of their existence.

53
00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:04.418
When we refer to search engines throughout
the course, we're mostly referring to

54
00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:08.440
Google as Google has the largest market
share out of all search engines.

55
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.734
While it's important to know
of other search engines and

56
00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:14.409
to not put all your eggs in one basket,
SEOs and

57
00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.683
clients have a large interest in
optimizing for Google, particularly.

58
00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:22.936
Some SEOs even joked that we are not
search engine optimization experts but

59
00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.830
Google optimization experts.

60
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.321
This is because Google is the most
widely used search engine, and

61
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:29.786
has the best market share.

62
00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:34.127
In addition, by optimizing for Google,
you're following website best practices

63
00:03:34.127 --> 00:03:37.440
that will help your site rank
better across the board.

64
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.140
This is an example of a search page
you'll see for the average search.

65
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.126
Each page has 10 organic results here
in the middle, along the top and

66
00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:48.230
side of the search result, you'll see ads.

67
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.730
These are what search
engine marketers focus on.

68
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.740
These ads been on queries or keywords
similar to what we optimize for an SEO.

69
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.340
So that ad will show up,
preferably on the first page of search.

70
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.797
When we talk about SEO, and
some of the changes that Google makes,

71
00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:06.439
it is important to remember that
Google is a for-profit enterprise,

72
00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.240
and these ads are how they make
a great deal of their profits.

73
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.950
Like search engine marketers,

74
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.010
SEOs want their website to show
on the first page as well.

75
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.740
However, we focus on the organic listings.

76
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.131
Our goal is to get our or our client's
website to show as high as possible for

77
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:25.146
relevant keywords within
these organic results.

78
00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:27.986
It is important to note
how clicks on a result and

79
00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:32.620
visits to a website are dramatically
affected by the position of the result.

80
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.963
Studies have shown that a little over
71% of all traffic to a website is

81
00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:39.840
visits from the first page of results.

82
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.840
Users are more likely to simply
refine their search query,

83
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.540
rather than continue on to
the second page of search results.

84
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.055
In fact, these first five results in
the organic listings bring the highest

85
00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:56.220
percentage of traffic, accounting for
approximately 68% of clicks to a website.

86
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.756
Boosting website just a few positions
in search can boost a website traffic

87
00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:01.850
significantly.

88
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.739
Alternatively, it's important to make sure
your site is healthy and well optimized,

89
00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:10.060
so you don't lose positions or traffic.

90
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.012
The trick, however,
is to make sure you are optimizing for

91
00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:17.640
the right keywords that are most likely to
lead to an engaged visitor who converts.

92
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.433
This will fall into keywords,
psychology and research,

93
00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:22.487
which we will cover an upcoming chapters.
